# TCG-MTS
Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical MTS
# Introducation
The TGC model is a medical multivariate time series imputation model based on the Gaussian Copula. The TGC leverages the Gaussian Copula model to explore cross-variable and temporal relationships based on Gaussian latent representations, and outputs the correlation matrices between different feature latent variables. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the TGC model outperforms traditional methods as well as deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, the TGC exhibits strong robustness when dealing with test datasets with high rates of missingness.
