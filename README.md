# TCG-MTS
Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical MTS, submited to BIBM 2024.
# Introducation
The TGC is a novel multivariate time series imputation approach. By employing a Gaussian Copula framework, the TGC effectively captures cross-variable and temporal dependencies within the data through the estimation of Gaussian latent representations. A key advantage of the TGC lies in its ability to output correlation matrices between different feature latent variables, providing valuable insights into the underlying relationships. Rigorous empirical evaluations on three commonly used datasets have consistently demonstrated the TGC's superior performance compared to both traditional imputation methods and deep learning-based techniques. Moreover, the TGC exhibits remarkable robustness when handling test datasets with high levels of missingness.
